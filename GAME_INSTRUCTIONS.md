## Overview

**Manipulation Factory** is an interactive multiplayer prebunking experience designed to train users in recognizing rhetorical manipulation techniques. Unlike fact-checking tools, this application focuses on **identifying manipulation tactics** rather than verifying facts, using neutral, educational examples.

### Key Concepts

- **Psychological Inoculation**: Builds long-term resistance to manipulation through experiential learning
- **Educational Focus**: Uses neutral topics (coffee, studies, technology, animals, weather) - no political content
- **Humor-Based Learning**: Makes learning engaging through exaggerated but non-offensive manipulative content
- **Multiplayer Experience**: Real-time interaction with other players and an AI participant
- **Reflection-Based**: Encourages critical thinking through comparison and reflection

## Scoring System

### How Points Are Calculated

**Base Points:**
- **10 points** per correctly identified technique
- **-5 points** per incorrectly selected technique

**Bonuses:**
- **+20 points** for identifying ALL techniques correctly (perfect round)
- **Up to +10 points** speed bonus (based on how fast you answered)

**Speed Bonus Formula:**
- Answers submitted quickly (near the 60-second mark) get maximum speed bonus
- Answers submitted later get progressively less bonus
- Formula: `(Time Remaining / Total Time) × 10`

### Example Scoring

**Scenario:** Post has 3 correct techniques (emotional_language, false_dilemma, scapegoating)

**Player A:**
- Selected: emotional_language, false_dilemma, scapegoating (all correct)
- Time: Answered in 45 seconds (15 seconds remaining)
- Score: (3 × 10) + 20 (perfect bonus) + ~2 (speed bonus) = **52 points**

**Player B:**
- Selected: emotional_language, false_dilemma, ad_hominem (2 correct, 1 wrong)
- Time: Answered in 30 seconds (30 seconds remaining)
- Score: (2 × 10) - 5 (incorrect) + ~5 (speed bonus) = **20 points**

**Player C:**
- Selected: Only emotional_language (1 correct, missed 2)
- Time: Answered in 10 seconds (50 seconds remaining)
- Score: (1 × 10) + ~8 (speed bonus) = **18 points**

### Scoring Tips

- ✅ **Accuracy over speed** - Getting all techniques right is worth more than being fast but wrong
- ✅ **Balance is key** - Don't select too many (penalty) or too few (missed points)
- ✅ **Speed matters** - But only if you're confident in your answer
- ✅ **Perfect rounds** - The +20 bonus makes it worth taking time to get everything right
